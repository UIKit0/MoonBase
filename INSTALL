Installation is fairly simple.

In the same directory as this README file do the following to build moonbase 
and install into the GAC.

$ make
$ sudo make install

You then just include the Moonlight.Gtk and MoonBase assemblies in your 
project. If you don't want to MoonBase in the GAC then do:

$ cd MoonBase
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
$ sudo make install

Have a look at the two example solutions.

Have fun :)
