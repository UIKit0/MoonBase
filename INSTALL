Installation is fairly simple.

You can build moonbase in monodevelop or visual studio or you can use mdtool 
to generate makefiles.

Building in Visual Studio or MonoDevelop
-----------------------------------------

If you are using monodevelop, load up MoonBase/MoonBase.sln and choose either 
the MonoDebug or MonoRelease configuration.

If you are aiming for .Net then choose one of the other configurations.

Building on the command line
-----------------------------

$ cd MoonBase
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

This should build and install moonbase and create pkg-config files that 
monodevelop and mono will be able to find.

To build manually, you can call:
 pkg-config mono.moondesk.moonbase --libs

To get the path to the install library.

Building From Github
---------------------

The same instructions as above apply. If you do find you want to develop 
MoonBase you can also re-generate the makefiles used above by running:

$ cd MoonBase
$ mdtool generate-makefiles -s MoonBase.sln
