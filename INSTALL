Installation is fairly simple.

You can build moonbase in monodevelop or visual studio or you can use mdtool 
to generate makefiles.

Building in Visual Studio or MonoDevelop
-----------------------------------------

If you are using monodevelop, load up MoonBase.sln and choose either the 
MonoDebug or MonoRelease configuration.

If you are aiming for .Net then choose one of the other configurations.

Building on the command line
-----------------------------

$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

This should build and install moonbase and create pkg-config files that 
monodevelop and mono will be able to find.

To build manually, you can call:
 pkg-config mono.moondesk.moonbase --libs

To get the path to the install library.
